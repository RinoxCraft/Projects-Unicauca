----> ARDUINO CON MAQUINA DE ESTADOS <-------------
This project is developed in the area of ​​Telematics Technology of the subject Digital Systems Laboratory-TTM-I, where it is based on the implementation of Arduino Mega 
as a basic prototype of a greenhouse.
Where software such as Arduino is used and its implementation in code with a State Machine, giving the following states as a path:
- START
- PASSWORD_VALIDATION
- BLOCKING
- SHOW_VALUES.

The usage elements are based on:
- Arduino Mega
- DHT22
- PhotoResistor
- RGB LEDs
- Potentiometer
- LCD screen (16*2)
- Keypad (4*3)
- Male-Male and Male-Female Wiring.

The usage code is generalized in the following image
